# Austin Public Library Innovation Lab - CMS Project

Welcome to the APL Innovation Lab CMS Project! This initiative is all about creating, innovating, and learning in the world of content management systems, specifically with a focus on Drupal. Our goal is to build a series of project repositories under the APL-Innovation-Lab GitHub Organization, each dedicated to setting up a barebones server environment like Drupal 9, but with a twist!

## Our Vision

We envision a platform where anyone, be it a seasoned developer or a curious learner, can jump in to experiment, contribute, and grow. Here's what we're setting up:

1. **Project Repositories**: Each repository under the APL-Innovation-Lab will focus on establishing a basic server environment, with Drupal 9 as our starting point.

2. **Custom Onboard Experience**: We’re not just setting up servers; we’re creating learning hubs. Each setup will be customized with APL Innovation Lab flair, guiding users in learning about and contributing to the Library's CMS.

3. **Diverse Platforms**: Leveraging DDEV, Laravel, Pantheon, and Acquia, we aim to simplify the process of setting up Drupal servers for each of the Library's website content types.

4. **Dummy Data Implementation**: To ensure a realistic yet secure environment, we’ll populate our servers with dummy data that echoes the Library's actual content—no personal information, no direct links to production servers.

5. **API Integration for Flexibility**: The cherry on top is our plan to explore API integrations with the Drupal site. This will open doors to demonstrate other CMSs or to connect various applications, offering a broader perspective beyond the Drupal UI.

## Get Involved
